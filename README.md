This application automatically moves itself and its data securely across cloud providers, depending on the share price changes of providers. The purpose of the application is to show that movement across cloud providers while securely transferring the data they use to function is possible. Share price will be the criteria that decides movement due to the fact that share prices regularly fluctuate, and this will allow regular movements between providers to take place.
